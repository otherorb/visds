# visdag

This is a [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) project scaffolded with [`dagster project scaffold`](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/create-new-project).

## Getting started

First, install your Dagster repository as a Python package. By using the --editable flag, pip will install your repository in ["editable mode"](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then, start the Dagit web server:
=======
# visds

Welcome to your new Dagster repository.

### Contents

| Name                     | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`              | A description and guide for this code repository                                  |
| `setup.py`               | A build script with Python package dependencies for this code repository          |
| `workspace.yaml`         | A file that specifies the location of the user code for Dagit and the Dagster CLI |
| `visds/`       | A Python directory that contains code for your Dagster repository                 |
| `visds_tests/` | A Python directory that contains tests for `visds`                      |

## Getting up and running

1. Create a new Python environment and activate.

**Pyenv**
```bash
export PYTHON_VERSION=X.Y.Z
pyenv install $PYTHON_VERSION
pyenv virtualenv $PYTHON_VERSION visds
pyenv activate visds
```

**Conda**
```bash
export PYTHON_VERSION=X.Y.Z
conda create --name visds python=PYTHON_VERSION
conda activate visds
```

2. Once you have activated your Python environment, install your repository as a Python package. By
using the `--editable` flag, `pip` will install your repository in
["editable mode"](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/?highlight=editable#editable-installs)
so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

## Local Development

1. Set the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable. Dagster will store run history in this directory.

```base
mkdir ~/dagster_home
export DAGSTER_HOME=~/dagster_home
```

2. Start the [Dagit process](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/dagit). This will start a Dagit web
server that, by default, is served on http://localhost:3000.

```bash
dagit
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.

You can start writing assets in `visdag/assets/`. The assets are automatically loaded into the Dagster repository as you define them.

## Development


### Adding new Python dependencies

You can specify new Python dependencies in `setup.py`.

### Unit testing

Tests are in the `visdag_tests` directory and you can run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest visdag_tests
```

### Schedules and sensors

If you want to enable Dagster [Schedules](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or [Sensors](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) for your jobs, start the [Dagster Daemon](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/dagster-daemon) process in the same folder as your `workspace.yaml` file, but in a different shell or terminal.

The `$DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable must be set to a directory for the daemon to work. Note: using directories within /tmp may cause issues. See [Dagster Instance default local behavior](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/dagster-instance#default-local-behavior) for more details.
=======
3. (Optional) If you want to enable Dagster
[Schedules](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/schedules-sensors/schedules) or
[Sensors](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/schedules-sensors/sensors) for your jobs, start the
[Dagster Daemon process](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/daemon#main) **in a different shell or terminal**:
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Once your Dagster Daemon is running, you can start turning on schedules and sensors for your jobs.

## Deploy on Dagster Cloud

The easiest way to deploy your Dagster project is to use Dagster Cloud.

Check out the [Dagster Cloud Documentation](https://docs.dagster.cloud) to learn more.
=======
## Local Testing

Tests can be found in `visds_tests` and are run with the following command:

```bash
pytest visds_tests
```

As you create Dagster ops and graphs, add tests in `visds_tests/` to check that your
code behaves as desired and does not break over time.

For hints on how to write tests for ops and graphs in Dagster,
[see our documentation tutorial on Testing](https://docs.dagster.io/tutorial/testable).
